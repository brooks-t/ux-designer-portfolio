# Brooks Tiffany - UX Designer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal UX design portfolio, a React-based application built with Vite and styled with Tailwind CSS. It's designed to showcase my work, skills, and professional experience in a clean, modern, and accessible format.

This project was built with the help of a generative AI assistant, which helped me quickly bootstrap the project, write code, and iterate on designs.
