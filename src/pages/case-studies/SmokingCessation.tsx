					<h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Project Overview</h2>
					<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
						The GEMS project was a multi-year research and development
						initiative aimed at designing and evaluating a novel mobile health
						(mHealth) intervention for the majority of smokers who want to quit
						someday but are not yet ready to make a commitment. The core of the
						intervention was a series of "personal experiments"â€”brief cognitive
						and behavioral tasks designed to build a user's motivation and
						ability to change their smoking habits at their own pace.
					</p>
					<p className="text-primary/70 mb-6">
						This was a complex project that spanned several years and moved
						through multiple government-funded phases, from initial ideation and
						competitive analysis to formative user testing and, ultimately, two
						peer-reviewed publications (since my addition to team) in the
						prestigious Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR).

						The Challenge: Engaging the Ambivalent

					<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
						Most smokers (around 70%) want to quit someday, but aren't ready to

						ready to quit immediately, leaving this vast, ambivalent majority

								Foundational Research & Competitive Analysis
							</h3>
							<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
								We began with deep foundational research. I conducted a
								competitive analysis of over 20 existing smoking cessation apps,
								which revealed that none were designed for ambivalent smokers
								and most lacked robust tracking features. I also led in-depth
								user interviews, where we learned that users wanted social
								support, progress tracking, and help cutting back slowly, not
								quitting "cold turkey".

								Concept Development & Lo-Fi Prototyping
							</h3>
							<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
								Armed with these insights, I developed initial user flowcharts
								that incorporated our core-concept of "Personal Experiments"
								which helped us map out the complex, multi-day user journey. I
								then designed and tested low-fidelity prototypes with users to
								refine the concept, confirming that users liked the "no

								Medium-Fidelity Field Prototype & "Wizard of Oz" Testing
							</h3>
							<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
								Incorporating user feedback, I designed a functional,
								medium-fidelity prototype for a pilot study. A key part of this
								phase was a "Wizard of Oz" field test, where I simulated
								back-end functionality to create a realistic user experience
								with people using the app on their phone while they go about
								their lives. This allowed us to collect rich, in-context
								feedback on the prototype before full development, which proved
								to be "highly acceptable" to participants.

								High-Fidelity Design & Developer Handoff
							</h3>
							<p className="text-primary/70 mb-4">
								Armed with insights from the successful "Wizard of Oz" field
								test, the project moved into its final and most crucial phase:
								translating our validated concept into a production-ready
								application. I designed a comprehensive, high-fidelity
								interactive prototype in Adobe XD, complete with detailed
								specifications for every component and user flow. The clarity
								and thoroughness of this design blueprint were instrumental in
								securing buy-in from the Kaiser Permanente development team, who
								agreed to build the app. Throughout the development cycle, I
								served as the primary design partner for the engineering team,
								providing real-time guidance on specs and behavior to ensure a
								faithful and accurate translation of the vision into code. The
								resulting application, built directly from my designs, was
								ultimately used in the randomized pilot trial that produced the
								impressive, published results in the 2023 JMIR paper.
