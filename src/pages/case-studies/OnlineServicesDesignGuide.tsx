						When our team found out that we needed to switch from Sketch &
						Invision to Figma under a tight deadline, I volunteered to spearhead
						the migration.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						To no surprise, I found out that even though Figma offers a feature
						to import Sketch files, those files did not translate well and were
						not truly compatible. As a result, the entire design guide needed to
						built from scratch to leverage the full power of Figma.
						<br></br>
						<br></br>
						Leading the charge, I quickly built the majority of the design
						guide, incorporating key Figma feature improvements such as
						autolayout and variants to ensure our UX team had a minimum viable
						product to work with and avoid any work stoppages. Since then,
						several other designers have contributed to and improved upon the
						initial version that I created.
